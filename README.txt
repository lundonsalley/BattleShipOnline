HOW TO PLAY

--------------------------pre game setup--------------------------

if you are the server, press s and wait

if you are the client, type in the server's ip address and then press
c once you are ready


if you are playing on a single computer, only press c and s for server and client respectively. 
dont worry about typing in any ip addresses

--------------------------setup--------------------------

during the setup, use the left mouse button to randomize the ships

once you're happy with the arrangement, use the right mouse button to confirm

--------------------------play phase--------------------------

during the play phase, you can click on any square and try to hit the
opponent's ships

press "m" for epic music :D

if you hit a powerup, you can get one of three different powerups

1. nuke - destroys a 3x3 square around where you click
2. sonar - tells you how many ship squares are within the 5x5 square around it
3. airstrike - 7 random spots are hit off the opponents board

--------------------------winning--------------------------

do not disappoint him...





GOOD LUCK!!!
